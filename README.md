-How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?

> 38?

- What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

> The first and second are positioning the lines while the thord determines how many lines 
there's going to be (the smaller the number, the more lines there are and vice versa).

---------------------------------------

- How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?

> 50 times

- What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?

> Increasing or decreasing the 10 on i = i + 10.

- How can you make the ellipse trail longer?

> Adding a number value to i < x.length, like + 50, as an example.
